                <p>
                    <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family
                    in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and
                    now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam 
                    of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry that took 
                    Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was
                    the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.
